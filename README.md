### Description

Here is a project which allows to verify the adaptations of your screen. An aligment tools,

it is an old program originally writes in the 90s by S. Jenkins & Time/Slice Systems. I modified it to make it more practical. For the tray icon, it is from subscriber of whom I forgot coordinates, forgive me. The program can check for the Color purity/Scales, Resolution, Static Convergence, Readability, Dynamic Convergence, Color Bars, Aspect Ratio and White Balance.

Even though I can not take all the honors of this concept I made beautiful additions...Vote...It's important for me...
